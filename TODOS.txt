bugs:
 timer can wrap

features:
 mahjong board should be full width/height 
  overlay controls
  slide in history
  overlay/insert required status (timer)
  iconified advanced status
  modal for win/lose

 use bootstrap icons for controls

 implement more board layouts

 need instructions

 animation for moves

 highlights not quite working for gnome tiles

 set webapp icon for ios

wishes:
 resize tiles but don't adjust x/y alone

 implement play tree examination
   is this board winnable
   is it currently winnable

 implement: ensure winnable starting board

 restructure play board to be entirely backbone
 
 implement other tile sets (gnome png, self owned colorized png)

 need something like requirejs to organize the templates

other:
 use camel case everywhere

 change attribute name: position to subposition or something

 use log4javascript

 fix board generation so it doesn't get traps.
