bugs:
 timer can wrap

features:
 splash icon should resize

 configuration should be cookied preferences so they save across refresh

 mahjong board should be full width/height 
  overlay controls
  slide in history
  overlay/insert required status (timer)
  iconified advanced status
  modal for win/lose

 add audio for moves, add mute button

 use bootstrap icons for controls

 configuration should be prettier (images for selects)

 implement more board layouts

 need instructions

 animation for moves

wishes:
 resize tiles but don't adjust x/y alone

 implement play tree examination
   is this board winnable
   is it currently winnable

 implement: ensure winnable starting board

 restructure play board to be entirely backbone
 
 implement tiles with colored bottoms

 implement other tile sets (gnome png, self owned colorized png)

 need something like requirejs to organize the templates
 
 rewrite tiles is be more like splash screen (span)

 clean up hit master to calculate coordinates in a more readible way
